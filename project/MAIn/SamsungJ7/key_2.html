Three key phone-shopping essentials<br>

<b><u>1. Don't be a cheapskate</u></b>

Contract or no contract, chances are high that once you commit to a new phone, you'll hang onto it for a while. Therefore, buy the best device you can afford. You'll need the camera quality and processor to last you as long as possible until your next upgrade. The battery, too, becomes less efficient at holding a charge as your phone ages, so you'll want to choose one with a high capacity.<br>

An added benefit of going for a high-end handset, say like an iPhone 6 or LG G4, is that the resale value tends to hold over time, so make your device an investment that pays off.<br>
